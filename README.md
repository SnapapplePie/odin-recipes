# Odin Recipes
This was originally a brief project to start getting used to HTML with the Odin Project - I've been developing it as I go. So far...

## Using CSS
I've used what I know about CSS so far to begin styling my page a little more, such as adding margins to buttons and rounding them, changing background colours, changing fonts, etc.

## Alignments and Inline/Block Elements
Not quite there yet but I'm getting used to the differences and how I might be able to use these types of elements.
